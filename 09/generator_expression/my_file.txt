In computer science,
a generator is a special routine that can be used to control the iteration behaviour of a loop. In fact,all generators are iterators.
A generator is very similar to a function that returns an array, in that a generator has parameters, can be called, and generates a sequence of values.
However, instead of building an array containing all the values and returning them all at once, a generator yields the values one at a time, which requires less memory and allows the caller to get started processing the first few values immediately.
In short, a generator looks like a function but behaves like an iterator.
